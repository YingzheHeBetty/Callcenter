# Callcenter
Java Object-oriented exercise:

A big retail company has a customer service call centre with employees, a supervisor, and a manager. There are multiple employees but there can be only one supervisor and one manager.

The employees answer the incoming calls. If an employee cannot handle the call, the call will be forwarded to the supervisor. If the supervisor is either busy or cannot handle the call, the call will be forward to the manager.

Please implement your design of the call centre.

Please consider concurrency in your solution.

Write unit tests for the method findCallHandler.

Please use Maven as your build manager.
